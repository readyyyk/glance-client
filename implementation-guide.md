# Implementation Guide

## Next Steps

To implement the Docker deployment solution, you'll need to:

1. Create the Dockerfile
2. Set up the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Configure Railway

Since we're currently in Architect mode, which can only edit Markdown files, you'll need to switch to Code mode to create the actual implementation files.

## Switching to Code Mode

You can switch to Code mode to implement the Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflow based on the templates provided in the `docker-implementation.md` file.

In Code mode, you'll be able to:

1. Create the `Dockerfile` in the project root
2. Create the `.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml` file for GitHub Actions
3. Make any necessary adjustments to these files based on your specific requirements

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create Dockerfile
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow file
- [ ] Set up Railway project
- [ ] Add RAILWAY_TOKEN to GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub
- [ ] Verify successful deployment to Railway

## Additional Considerations

- Consider using environment variables in Railway instead of hardcoding them in the Dockerfile
- Make sure your GitHub repository is set up to allow GitHub Actions to create and push packages
- Test the deployment process end-to-end to ensure everything works as expected
